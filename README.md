# Chocolatey packages

This repo hosts the source of some packages for Chocolatey.

I've maintained them as long as I used them. But currently I don't even have access to a machine, where I can build and push new packages.

If you want to update them, contact me, we'll arrange that.

If you want to take over some packages to your build infrastructure with a different layout, also contact me.

Thanks.
